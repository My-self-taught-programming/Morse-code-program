# Morse-code-program

This program was the first program I made without following an online programming course. The program contains concepts and methods which I have learnt in an online course and some which I had to learn by myself and were ahead of any online course I am currently participating in. In order to complete this program the way I wanted it to be it also required me to try to reverse engineer open-source code which gave me the knowledge on how the encryption and decryption functions worked.
